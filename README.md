## Pleasure to meet you! My name is Richard Kim.

I am a Rising Junior in Highschool in the Bronx. I attend Riverdale Kingsbridge Academy 141. I am a 4.0 GPA student with many passions, including Aeronautical and Mechanical engineering. I am proficient in both Google and Microsoft Office Suite, Tinkercad, and 3D print fabrication. I am currently expanding my STEM knowledge in coding and AI to enhance my engineering skills.
